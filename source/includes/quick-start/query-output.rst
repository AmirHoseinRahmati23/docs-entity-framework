When you run ``Program.cs``, it should output the plot of "Back to the Future" from
the sample dataset:

.. code-block:: json

   A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean
   invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, and must make sure his high-school-age
   parents unite in order to save his own existence.
